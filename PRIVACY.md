# Privacy Policy for WatchLater Zap

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how WatchLater Zap ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. WatchLater Zap is a Chrome extension designed to help users clear their YouTube Watch Later playlist with a single click.

## Data Collection and Usage

**WatchLater Zap does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

The extension operates entirely within the browser and only interacts with YouTube's Watch Later playlist page when explicitly activated by the user. All operations are performed locally on your device.

### Specific Non-Collection Statement:

- **Personal Information**: The extension does not collect any personally identifiable information.
- **Browsing History**: The extension does not track or store your browsing history.
- **YouTube Account Information**: The extension does not access, collect, or store any information about your YouTube account beyond what is visible on the Watch Later page during operation.
- **Video Information**: While the extension interacts with videos in your Watch Later playlist to remove them, it does not collect, store, or transmit information about these videos.

## Permissions

WatchLater Zap requires the following permissions:

1. **scripting**: Used to inject and execute code on YouTube Watch Later pages to automate the video deletion process.
2. **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access the current tab only when you click on the extension icon.
3. **youtube.com host permission**: Enables the extension to function specifically on YouTube pages, particularly the Watch Later playlist.

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension and not for data collection purposes.

## Third-Party Services

WatchLater Zap does not use any third-party services and does not share any data with third parties.
